## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akosikhada/100-days-of-javascript.git
   cd 100-days-of-javascript
   ```

2. **Choose a Project**

   - Browse the Project List section below to find a project that interests you
   - Each project has a difficulty level suitable for different skill levels
   - Start with simpler projects if you're a beginner

3. **Project Setup**

   - **For Vanilla JS Projects** (majority):

     - No build or installation required
     - Simply open the project folder and launch `index.html` in your browser

   - **For React/Tailwind Projects**:
     ```bash
     cd "Day #XX"  # Navigate to the project folder
     npm install   # Install dependencies
     npm run dev   # Start development server
     ```
     - Open the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173 or similar)

4. **Explore and Learn**
   - Read the project's individual README for specific instructions
   - Examine the code to understand the implementation
   - Try modifying the code to extend functionality
   - Use the browser's developer tools to debug and explore

## 📋 Usage & Structure

### Project Organization

Each project is contained in its own folder with a consistent structure:

```
Day #XX/
├── index.html         # Main HTML page and entry point
├── style.css          # CSS styling and animations
├── script.js          # Core JavaScript functionality
├── README.md          # Project documentation and instructions
├── assets/            # Images, fonts, and other static assets (if applicable)
└── package.json       # Dependencies for React projects (if applicable)
```

### Running Projects

1. **Vanilla JavaScript Projects**:

   - Navigate to the project folder
   - Open `index.html` directly in your browser
   - No server or build process required

2. **React Projects**:

   - Navigate to the project folder
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
   - Open the provided URL in your browser

3. **Working with Project Code**:

   - Each project is designed to be self-contained and modifiable
   - The code is thoroughly commented for ease of understanding
   - Feel free to experiment and extend the functionality

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If a project doesn't work as expected, check the browser console for errors
   - Ensure all file paths are correct if you've moved or renamed folders
   - For React projects, make sure all dependencies are installed properly

> **Note**: Some operating systems may have issues with folder names containing special characters like "#". If you encounter problems, consider renaming the folder to just the day number (e.g., "Day01" instead of "Day #01").
