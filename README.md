## üìù Overview

The 100 Days of JavaScript is a code collection challenge where you build a new project each day to learn and practice web development. This repository gathers all those projects, covering many topics and skills. Each project has its own guide to help you start, use, and understand the code.

## üîë Key Features

- Diverse collection of JavaScript projects designed to build and reinforce core web development skills.
- Emphasis on hands-on, practical learning through real coding challenges.
- Covers a wide range of topics, from basic DOM manipulation to advanced UI and API integration.
- Encourages consistent practice, creativity, and problem-solving.
- Promotes modern coding standards, responsive design, and clean code organization.
- Each project is self-contained with its own documentation, making it easy to explore, learn, and extend.
- Suitable for learners, hobbyists, and developers seeking to expand their JavaScript portfolio.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for all projects
- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **React**: Used in selected advanced projects
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for modern UI components
- **Various APIs**: Integration with external services

## üöÄ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akosikhada/100-days-of-javascript.git
   cd 100-days-of-javascript
   ```

2. **Project setup depends on the folder:**

   - For most projects (vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS): No installation needed. Just open `index.html` in your browser.
   - For React/Tailwind projects: Run `npm install` in the project folder, then start with `npm run dev`.

3. **Open any project**
   - Navigate to the project folder of your choice
   - Follow the setup instructions in that folder's README for details

## üìã Usage

Each project folder contains its own implementation with the following structure:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file
- `style.css` - Styling for the project
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality

To run any project:

1. Open the project folder
2. **Important**: You may need to rename the folder to remove special characters like "#" and "-" for proper functionality
3. Double-click on the `index.html` file or open it with your preferred browser
4. Interact with the application as intended
